## EASE Lab Explorations with Azure Kinect

Dr. Amon Millner, Hwei-Shin Harriman, Richard Gao of the Olin College of Engineering Extending Access to STEM Empowerment (EASE) Lab are engaging with the Microsoft Azure Kinect Development Kit to leverage its unique features in a context related to step performances.

Through this page, we are sharing early experiments in adding new dimensions to step performances.
