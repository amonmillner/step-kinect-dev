## Welcome to Amon Millner's Playful Portfolio

As an Assistant Professor of Computing and Innovation at the Olin College of Engineering, I teach courses that encourage students to learn how to use GitHub as they learn how to make projects using Python. One of the class sessions is dedicated to highlighting the merits of using the GitHub Pages feature to host a portfolio of software projects. 

### The Totem Game

I created an example to use as a demo of one way to conduct a code review for my Software Design students. Click the link below to read about the Totem Game.
